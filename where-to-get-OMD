Here you can download OMD - which is the best way to install Nagios
Pick the right version for your distro.

http://labs.consol.de/lang/de/nagios/omd-repository/

You'll want a recent version since there's an issue with the JSON data in
older versions.

for centos/rhel you need the epel or similar repos installed

for debian ubuntu just install....

You _ALSO_ must switch to apache mpm prefork
(aptitude search ...)


after installing do


	# create two fullblown nagios envs
	omd create mytestsite
	omd create mytestsite2

	# launch your two new nagios instances
	omd start


	and follow the instructions there
